Optimization of Search Engine Feedback Through Query Expansion

This project contains 3 major parts:
1. A query expansion API built completely with python.
2. A custom search engine based on google powered by PHP.
3. A custom search engine also based on google but with query expansion integrated.

With query expansion, when a user inputs a query of short length, the expansion model uses its algorithm to search for relevant terms and add to the query to improve quality of documents retrieved.
The documents retrieved will not only talk about the original query but also give more information on other relevant things due to the addition of relevant terms.
